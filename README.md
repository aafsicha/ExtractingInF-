# ExtractingInF#

Original code is from Pauline Jamin and Caroline Desplanques 
Their kata was to pull the domain out of a N-tier app and go towards en hexagone.

Here i want to start from the same point but i will i will go towards f#.
What i want to see is:
- is it easy to inteop a f# domain inside a fully fledge c# app
- is the end result of the f# domain any clearer than the c# one
- could it be a way make a team pivot towards f# ?
